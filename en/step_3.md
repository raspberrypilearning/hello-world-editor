The `import` lines tell Python that you are going to use code you didn't write.

--- code ---

language: python
filename: main.py

## Sums and dates

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Python is great at working with numbers and dates.
</div>

In Python you can use maths operators to do sums:

| + | add |   
| - | subtract |   
| * | multiply |   
| / | divide |   
| ** | to the power |

Add another two `print()` lines to your code including a sum for Python to work out:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 12
line_highlights: 14-15
---

print('Hello', world)   
print('Welcome to', python)   
print(python, 'is very good at', sums)   
print(230 * 5782 ** 2 / 23781)   

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code. Did Python calculate the sum correctly? Only joking! Python does the hard maths for you so you don't need to work it out.

Japanese computer scientist <span style="color: #0faeb0">**Emma Haruka Iwao**</span> used a computer to calculate the value of Pi (*Ï€*) to 31 trillion digits. That answer is so long that it would take over 300,000 years just to say it!

Try changing the sum that Python does to a complicated one!

You can also use brackets if you want to control the order that Python calculates the sum: `print( (2 + 4) * (5 + 3) )`.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code and get Python to calculate your sum.

**Debug:** Make sure your sum has a left and right round bracket around it `( 2 * 45 )`. If you use extra brackets to control the order, make you have a right bracket to match every left bracket.

If you have asked Python to calculate a really big sum, you might find the answer goes across multiple lines in the output area. 

**Tip:** Click on the **hamburger menu** (the icon with three lines) in the top-left of your Trinket editor. Then click on the **Fullscreen** button to view your project in fullscreen mode.

To exit fullscreen mode, click on the **Fullscreen** button again or press <kbd>Esc</kbd> on your keyboard.

The line `from datetime import *` at the top of the **main.py** tab includes a library with helpful functions for getting the current date and time.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
One of the great things about Python is all the <span style="color: #0faeb0">**libraries**</span> of code that are available to use. A Python library allows you to easily use code that other people have written. There are libraries for drawing charts and graphs, making art, doing calculations, and lots more.

Add another line to your code to `print` some more text and the emoji variables `calendar` and `clock`.

Get the current date and time by using the `now()` function from the `datetime` library:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 14
line_highlights: 16-17
---

print(python, 'is very good at', sums)    
print(230 * 5782 ** 2 / 23781) #Print the result of the sum     
print('The', calendar, clock, 'is', datetime.now()) #Print with emoji    
 
--- /code ---

**Tip:** You don't need to type the comments, they are just there to help you understand the code. Just type the part before the `#`.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code a couple of times to see the date and time update.

**Debug:** Check that you have a fullstop `.` between `datetime` and `now`. Check all the punctuation carefully.
