Add more `print` lines to your code. Here are some sentence starters that you can use:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
---

print('I', heart, '...')   
print('... makes me', happy)   
print('I\'d like to make ... with', python)   

--- /code ---

**Tip:** `print` adds a space between each item you print. 

**Tip:** If you need to print an apostrophe `'` then you need to put a backslash `\` before it so Python knows it's part of the text.
